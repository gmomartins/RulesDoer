# RulesDoer

DMN 1.2 Rules Engine written in net core C#

Work in progress.

## Tasks in progress

1. Complete FEEL grammar to C# - My mother loves Antlr

2. Update the DMN xsd transformer from 1.1 to 1.2 - New stuff

3. Add a Web API

4. UI for rules input / Have not decided SPA or good old Net Core MVC

## How to run this stuff

1. Clone this stuff then run the tests. That is all for now until the fancy UI or Web API is created.

2. Then tell your mother you love her
